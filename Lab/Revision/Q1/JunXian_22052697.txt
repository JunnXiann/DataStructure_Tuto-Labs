My name is Tan Jun Xian with matrix number, 22052697. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling normal about taking this subject. This is because i'm familiar with the contents of the subject already but im willing to learn and revise along the way.
I acquired 4.0 for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get 4.0 again for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will continue practicing. Wish me luck!!!

I've performed well in class.
